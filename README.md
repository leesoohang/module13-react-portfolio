# Module Challenge – React Portfolio
## Description
This project is to create a portfolio using React, with navigation links using React Router. 

For this application to work, Vite is required to initialize the localhost website, Bootstrap and React Router are also required to enable component styling and rendering.

The most difficult part of this project is to dynamically render content for each project in the Projects section. The Outlet feature is very useful to display the child items within the Projects page without creating additional links back to this section.

One thing I overlooked is that the export component must be named with a capital letter – it took me a while to troubleshoot the functions and elements I coded because there were no errors indicated. But once I renamed the exported components it worked properly.
